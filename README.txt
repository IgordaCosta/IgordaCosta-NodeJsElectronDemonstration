Works on Windows 8.1 / 10 / 11

To run the app:
    Create a virtual environment using the name e564 
    and update it with the requirements.txt file
        > remember to delete the e564 folder first

    # This installs the virtual environment module
    pip install virtualenv
    
    # Creates a virtual environment using the module
    python -m venv e564

    # Activates the virtual environment
    e564\Scripts\activate

    # Installs the required modules with the correct versions
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
    #start app
    npm start









Please note, this app is for demostration only, it is a very small part of a large app,
it is on purpose not production ready, nor is it upgraded for speed, thus it will contains
many print(), and console.log() and a few comments.
